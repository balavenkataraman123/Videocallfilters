# Videocallfilters

Is online school on zoom boring? 
Did you just say something cool and would like to put on cool shades? 
The Technoplus Autofilter has you covered. Whether or not the videocall software you are using has filters, you'll be able to use them and look cool.

This uses a haar cascade to detect your face and draws sunglasses over your face if you activate it

how to use:
download all the files here except readme.md, keep them in the same folder

You need the latest version of OBS. install it or update your current one, then in your videocall software select 'obs virtual camera'
run the program, press f8 key to toggle activation

depending on your camera resolution adjust the variables camwidth, camheignt, and camscale
camwidth and camheight are the width and height of your camera
camscale is the width of your camera divided by 1920. yes it can be a float less than 1

I am working on a much better filter software that can do a lot more than just draw sunglasses on your face, is more user friendly, has a GUI and much more
I will release it on the Technoplus website when I finish making the Technoplus website
